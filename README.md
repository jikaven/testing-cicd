# GitHub actions testing

This repo holds GitHub action definitions for pipeline creation on GitHub.  
In my humble opinion GitLab is a better tool for this, but a task is a task.

I was not able to run the python greeting app for some reason. Even manually launching the greeting apps using pm2. The application errors out 15 times and does not launch.  
I was able to launch the `app.py`, but that has a hardcoded port and it would be too out of scope for this task to try to modify it after cloning the repository.
